## Description
This project is a way for me to relearn my ReactJS skills by copied my own previous ReactJS project ([Pics Paradise](https://github.com/ppskpunpun/Pics-Paradise)). But if i just copied the whole things then what's the differences between this one and an old one. That why I decided to learn something new along while recreating this project and it is Bootstrap.

## Getting Started
You can run it locally or wait for me to put it on my Github Page.
### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ppskpunpun/pics-paradise-clone-bootstrap.git
```
2. Navigate to the repo directory
```bash
cd pics-paradise-clone-bootstrap
```
3. Install NPM packages
```bash
npm install
```
4. Create a .env file and set the API key for Unsplash
```
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="Enter Your Key Here"
```
5. Start the server locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage
This is an image gallery webapplication, so you can view images. What more?
- See random images on the homepage
- Search for images you want to see by using search bar at the top of the page
- Maybe click an image and view it individually (Wait for me to implement that function â€”IDK when, though)

## Contributing
You can suggest me the better ways to implement something in Issues tab.
